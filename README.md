Disclaimer: this is a for fun project, the code is not 100% mine and there can very possibly be bugs and mistakes, though I plan to improve it, making it 100% foolproof during debutes and up to 5 pieces endgames.

ToDo:
1. Import masters database for engine to know the theory of debutes
2. Import Syzygy 3-4-5 for it to be 100% certain about correct moves in up to 5 pieces endgames
3. Fix some minor bugs, mainly async between backend and frontend
4. Optimize it (mainly utilizing flows)
5. Make the graphics more appealing and user-friendly
